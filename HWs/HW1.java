    Steps:
        1) Recreate the hello world program from today's class on your local computer in this file below the end of this block comment.

        2) Change the text to output "Hello World, I am [YOUR NAME]!" where [YOUR NAME] is replaced with your actual name first and last.

        3) Compile and run the program, if you need help look at the slides. Make sure it outputs the Hello world text.

        4) Take a screenshot of the command window with the output in it, save the screenshot as HW1.jpg and upload to Moodle along with your modified version of this file.

    Grading:
        50% - Screenshot of "Hello World, I am [YOUR NAME]!"
