    Description:
        In your fourth assignment, you will show me that you know how to encode and decode characters from ascii, Strings and ints. The program will take an initial number (0 for decoding, 1 for encoding) to determine if you are encoding or decoding. If encoding, it takes a String and outputs all the ascii character codes of that String separated by spaces. If you choose to decode you input the ascii codes of each character separated by spaces, and the original String is output.

    Steps:
        1) Fill in the missing sections of code indicated by comments bellow.

        2) Compile and run the program, and test it with a few different imputs.

        3) Upload to Moodle your modified version of this file.

    Example input and output cases:
        //I will use different test cases than these to grade. These test cases are so that you will know if your program is working or not.
       
        "0 to Decode, 1 to Encode
        1
        HELLO STUDENT
        72 69 76 76 79 32 83 84 85 68 69 78 84"

        "0 to Decode, 1 to Encode
        0
        72 69 76 76 79 32 83 84 85 68 69 78 84
        HELLO STUDENT"

        "0 to Decode, 1 to Encode
        0
        72 69 68 71 69 72 79 71 83 32 65 82 69 32 76 73 70 69
