Assignment: Invasion

Description:
In your second project you will make an AI to play the game I made, "Invasion". Your AI plays against another AI for dominion of the stars! Whoever ends up with the best AI wins a Surface 3! 

Steps:
1) Download the files below from: https://github.com/NeverNotGlow/TCP_FALL2017/tree/master/Invasion
    AI_To_Beat.zip  
    AI_To_Edit.zip 
    Invasion.jar 

2) Run the game. Invasion.jar is the server and the game, and you connect two AI clients to it.
  You can run Invasion.jar like this: java -jar Invasion.jar
  You can compile an AI.java (Network.java needs to be in the same folder) like this: javac *.java
  You can run an AI like this: java AI
  You can optionally pass in an IP adress to the AI like this: java AI [IP]
  You need two copies of AI connected to the server for the game to start (as in you need two command prompts running AIs)

3) Copy the folder AI_To_Edit and edit AI.java to make your own AI. Test it against the original version and the one in AI_To_Edit

4) Make sure its good and prepare to battle!

Grading:
Your grade is out of 10. Below I have laid out what you need to do to get what grade:

5 to 8 - An AI That can beat the basic AI included in the file AI_To_Edit

9 to 10 - An AI that can beat the AI in AI_To_Beat

Above 10 - Use machine learning or make one of the top AIs
