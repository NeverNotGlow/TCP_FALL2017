Assignment: TCP Dungeon

Description:
In your first project you will make a room in the notorious TCP dungeon located below the school. To do this create a class that extends Room and create a mini game. Look at the example rooms included in the github download.

Steps:
1) Download the project from: https://github.com/NeverNotGlow/TCPDungeon

2) Play the game with the rooms I made

3) Read the code of my rooms to learn how to use the Player and Dungeon classes

4) Make your own class that extends Room. The playerEnters() method is where the room actually starts (the equivalent of a main function) and should return true if the player was successful in the room, and false if the player was unsuccessful in the room (this will damage the player one health).

5) Play your game a lot and make sure its good!

Grading:
Your grade is out of 10. Bellow I have layed out what you need to do to get what grade:

0 to 3 - It runs but does not do much

4 to 6 - A couple of branches in a simple story 

7 to 8 - A complex multi branch story (SadRobot.java is in this range)

9 to 10 - A complex multi branch story with extra mechanics (not just a choose your own adventure, you need at least one more game mechanic) or a full game such as Tic Tac To (GuessingGame.java and FastMath.java are both in this range)

Above 10 - Make something that is really impressive :)

Required files in your submission:
- [your room name].java that you have created
